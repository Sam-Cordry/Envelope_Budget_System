# Envelope_Budget_System
A work-in-progress Apple project that is meant to provide users with the ability to budget their finances by using envelopes.

This project does not have completed features yet. It is not meant to be used in actual practice yet. If you would like to try it out and see how it works, the username is "root" and the password is "toor". The project files are included if you would like to see how it works under the hood.
